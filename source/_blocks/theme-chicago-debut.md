This painting, _Street in Venice_, was first shown at the Art Institute in 1890 and was one of Sargent’s first paintings on view in Chicago. It drew crowds of visitors to the museum, helping to put Chicago on the map as a center for contemporary art and culture.

 Over the next three decades, dozens of portraits by Sargent traveled to the city for exhibition, including at the World’s Columbian Exposition in 1893.
