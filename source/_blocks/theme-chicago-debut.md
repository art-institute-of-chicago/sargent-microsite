This painting, _Street in Venice_, was first shown in 1888 and was one of Sargent’s first paintings on view in Chicago. It drew crowds of visitors, helping to put Chicago on the map as a center for contemporary art and culture.

 Over the next four decades, dozens of paintings by Sargent traveled to the city for exhibition, including at the World’s Columbian Exposition in 1893.
