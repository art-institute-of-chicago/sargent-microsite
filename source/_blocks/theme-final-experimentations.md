    alt: "A very wide canvas painted in yellows, oranges, greens and browns. A woman is in the center of the painting wearing a piece of fabric around her waist, holding her hand vertically in front of her, and looking to the side. To her left are three figures in conversation while one holds on to a tree branch. A brown dog stands alert nearby. To her right stands another figure with her back facing us, and another sitting on a black horse while a small dog darts past. In the bottom right of the canvas, two black dogs hold up a plaque that reads 'Faa iheihe, Paul Gauguin, 1898'"

Gauguin was radically creative throughout his career. He never stopped experimenting with new methods, and his art continues to fascinate because it remains unpredictable, contradictory, and enormously varied in medium, form, and content.
