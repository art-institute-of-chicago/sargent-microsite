    alt: "A painting of a large, open room with many architectural details. Four large, white pillars lead the viewer through an exterior corridor with high, domed ceilings to a doorway that seems to lead to the interior of the home. Large, lush plants can be seen in the sun-filled patio just out of view."

While best known for his remarkable portraits, Sargent pursued a wide range of genres and media throughout his career. After stepping away from portrait commissions in 1907, he continued to enjoy broad success—with his fellow artists, patrons, and the public—as he created landscapes, watercolors, and murals.
