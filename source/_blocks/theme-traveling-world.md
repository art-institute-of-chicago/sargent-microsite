    alt: "A fan showing four figures in an idyllic pasture. A figure on the right is sitting with a platter of fruit. In the middle, three figures are surveying the landscape and picking fruit from a nearby tree. One holds a bowl of food. On the left, partly hidden behind a bush, a cow stands on the shoreline, with gentle waves lapping against scattered stones."

    alt: "A large ceramic crate that stands on a sturdy base. A scene of a woman on a farm is carved and painted on the front. She is sitting in the grass holding a stick. A black dog and a white duck stand nearby, near a small wooden fence. A large, bright green field of rolling hills is seen in the background."

    alt: "This is a flat wood carving depicting a male figure standing in a forested landscape. He leans forward, steadying himself against an overhanging branch, as he looks forth at what appears to be a waterfal."

    alt: "Painted in bright colors, two figures are seen sitting on a ledge overlooking brown and white sheep grazing on a farm atop a hill. Painterly brushstrokes of simplified forms in orange and green cover the trees and the roof of a barn is seen below. A view of the valley is seen in the background with mountains in the far distance."

Gauguin spent the first six years of his life in Peru and, as an adult, lived in Paris, Brittany, Martinique, Tahiti, and the Marquesas Islands. In every place, he absorbed—and reinvented—the local artistic and cultural traditions.
